          	<p>It's Christmas time again! Christmas has always been one of my favorite times of the year. Now if only adults got a "Winter Break"
          		like the school kids do it would really feel like Christmas.</p>
          	<P>Following Christmas I am sure we will have the annual media tsunami of Top 10 lists, Year in Review stories, and New Year's Resolutions. The top 10
          		lists get old after a while, and the Year in Review stories can be somewhat interesting. But what really interests me are the New Year's
          		Resolutions.</P>
          	<p>I've never been a big believer in making New Year's Resolutions and I think the <a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/"
          		target="_blank"> statistics</a> will back me up. I think that more often than not people bite off a bit more than they can chew, give a half hearted effort, and then fail. I don't think that is an effective
          		method of self improvement.</p>
          	<p>I've been on a recent self improvement kick, and I'm not entirely sure where the inspiration came from. For just over 2 years I had been
          		more than happy to just coast along in my rut. Then I'm not sure what changed, but I started to go a little bit stir crazy. Then I began
          		looking into learning about programming and web development (See <a href="#121313">my previous post</a>). Once I got that ball rolling I 
          		decided that I needed to clean up my diet and get back into shape. I went from drinking at least a six pack of soda per day to none. I 
          		still have an occasional soft drink when I eat out, but that's pretty much it. I don't have to go to Costco once a week now for a case of
          		Pepsi. I went from being a couch potato who went for a run on average once every 3 months or so to having an actual plan and exercise 
          		routine. (If you're interested <a href="http://www.hasfit.com" target="_blank" >HasFit.com</a> has been a great resource)</p>

          	<p>So far all of these efforts have had visible and objective results with relatively minor lifestyle changes. 6 months ago I could use the internet
          		pretty well. Now I can help to create the internet! That's a powerful feeling! Looking at my belt I can see the notches that I used to use, and
          		what I currently use. I can see a difference in my body when I look in the mirror. By New Year's I'll look like Christian Bale in Batman Begins.</p>
          	<div class="row">
          		<div class="large-6 columns">
          			<p>Just joking about Christian Bale. Just look at this man.</p>
          			<p>So now I'll get to my point. Rather than making a proclimation of a major lifestyle change a la a New Year's Resolution, I think it's a much
          		better idea to commit to baby steps. Instead of "This year I'm going to get in shape" I think it's a lot more reasonable to say "Starting with
          		the new year I am going to start working out for 30 minutes 3 days a week", or instead of "I'm going to learn Spanish" something more like 
          		"I'm going to use DuoLingo for 10 minutes a day". I think a strategy of small changes that give real results is a much more effective method.</p>

          	</div>
          	
          	<p>Now that I've finished my rant on traditional New Year's Resolutions, I'm going to give my goals for 2014.</p>
          	
          	<div class="row">
          		<div class="large-1 columns"><h1></h1></div>
	          	<div class="panel large-10 columns">
		          	<ul>
		          		<li>Gain an average of 1 new client every 3 months</li>
		          		<p>Weitzel Web Designs is still in it's infancy. I want to build meaningful relationships with my clients and deliver them quality work
		          			that they are 100% satisfied with. Being new to the business side of this I don't want to over commit myself. That's why it's a low number.</p>
		          		<li>Spend 30 minutes of each work day learning a CSS Pre-processor (probably SASS) and have it be part of the development process by the end of the year</li>
		          		<p>CSS is the programming language that provides the style for web pages (fonts, colors, borders, etc.). It is relatively limited compared to other
		          			programming languages. Using a pre-processor like SASS can make you a much more efficient developer. This will most likely be my next big project
		          			once I am a bit more stable at using Ruby on Rails</p>
		          		<li>Develop a functional site using Ruby on Rails by July</li>
		          		<p>Right now I am in the shallow end of Ruby on Rails. Much of the development process still goes over my head, and I have to re-read and re-watch
		          			lessons pretty regularly. But I'm making progress, and that's what matters. I think by July I'll have enough of Rails under my belt to 
		          			unleash something on the world. Not 100% sure what that something will be yet, so stay tuned.</p>
		          	</ul>
		         </div>
		         <div class="large-1 columns"></div>
	         </div>
	         
          	<p>That's my plan. If by this time next year I have 4 clients, am using SASS on my projects, and have a Rails based site up and running I will have
          		achieved my goals. Each item of the list is relatively small, but will provide objective and concrete results. Each item is also going to be a 
          		challenge. For example, I'm not good at sales. So far my pitch has essentially been "Want a web site? No? Ok...here's my card". Not literally of 
          		course, but to achieve my goal of developing clients I'm going to have to get better at selling myself and my skills. Each goal has it's own unique 
          		challenges that I'm going to have to overcome.</p>
          	<p>And that's what a New Year's resolution is all about, ending next year as a better person than you ended this year.</p>
          	<br>
          	<h4>Have a Merry Christmas!</h4>
          	
          	    <!-- <p>Another year has past, and Christmas has snuck up on me as usual. It's an interesting phenomenon if you think about it. After Halloween
            	any child between the ages of 4 and 16 can probably tell you to the hour how long it is until Christmas. It consumes their entire consciousness.
            	But as adults, even though we are experts at using calendars, using planners, and setting reminders Christmas still seems to sneek up on every one 
            	of us. We end up at the mall elbowing strangers as we wander aimlessly looking for the perfect present for that special someone. For such a magical
            	time of the year it sure can be stressful! But no matter how stressful it seems to be or how much we dread spending time with our in-laws it really 
            	is a mgical time of the year.</p>
            <p>For me personally Christmas has always been more of a season than a particular day. My parents both worked jobs that needed to be done on Christmas 
            	as they did every other day of the year. It was rare that both of my parents had Christmas off. That may sound like it would be difficult, but it 
            	really wasn't. My parents had a deal with Santa Claus where he would come on the nearest day that everyone could be together.</p>
            <p>Having a "floating" Christmas as a kid helped me to understand what Christmas is all about. Christmas isn't about the morning of December 25th when
            	you run down the stairs and behold the glory of a sea of gift wrapped presents bursting from beneath the Christmas tree. Many years the morning of 
            	December 25th didn't involve any presents for us. It may have been the 23rd, or the 27th. What was important was that we were able to be there with
            	each other as a family. And whatever day THAT happend to be was the day we burst from our bedrooms and beheld the glory of sea of gift wrapped
            	awesomeness. </p>
            <p>We haven't figure out if it was nature or nurture yet, but now as a father I find my family in the same situation. In my line of work (my day job at 
            	at least) I have to work Christmas about half of the time. But it doesn't bother me too much. The folks I come across in my day job are usually 
            	very appreciative that I'm there, and often bring by some turkey or pie. And I already know that I've either already enjoyed MY Christmas with my family,
            	or that I will be in a day or two.</p> 
            	
           Not sure where I was going with all that....but I'm not sure it's right for the blog... -->

	        <h3>Hello World!</h3>
	        <h6>Written by <span class="author">Norman Weitzel</span> on December 13, 2013.</h6>
	 
	        <div class="row">
	          <div class="large-6 columns">
	            <p>Hello World! My name is Norm, and I'm delighted and surprised that you've found my blog. As this is my first post I'm going to use it to
	            	lay out my hopes and dreams for this site and business. </p>
	            	
	            <p>Web design and development is a new skill for me, and it was not a straight path that brought me here. Originally I had an idea for an 
	            	Android app that I wanted to build. After doing some research I discovered that despite looking relatively simple mobile apps are quite 
	            	complicated to build, especially for someone that has minimal programming experience. Prior to my current journey my only experience was
	            	one semester of Pascal in high school!</p>
	            <p>So I began learning. I looked all over the web, read articles, watched tutorials, and realized that I was in over my head. While I remembered
	            	some of the basic programming principals from my high school days I had a lot to learn to get my feet under me. I went over to 
	            	<a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> and started learning.</p>
	          </div>
	          <div class="large-6 columns centered">
	            <img src="img/helloWorld.jpg" />
	          </div> 
	          <br>
	        </div>
	
	
	          <div class="row">
	          	<div class="large-9 columns">
	            
	            <p>After getting the basics down there I branched out and found many more resources to learn from. I started building simple web pages
	            	and getting comfortable with all the different components. Somewhere along the way I realized that instead of trying to come up with
	            	fake sites to make to build my skills, I should try some real world applications.</p>
	            <p>So I tried recreating web sites of places and business I knew. That naturally led to me adding my own touches and improvements, and
	            	 eventually led to me completely redesigning several sites.</p>
	            <p>And that's how Weitzel Web Designs was born. I realized that I was doing work that was (in my opinion) better. After finding out how
	            	much some folks were paying for what seemed to be relatively simple sites I was blown away. I decided I could do better work for less money</p>
	            <p>As far as the business goes, that's where we're at. I haven't signed any paying customers yet, but I hope to soon. But there's more to life
	            	than making money. I've realized that I really enjoy web design and development! So I'm still honing my skills, writing as much code as 
	            	I can, and learning as much as I can. The Android app may still be in my future, but I've got some other shiney new objects to play with
	            	for now.</p>
	            <p>My current project is learning a programming language called Ruby, and more specifically how to use a framework called Ruby on Rails to develop
	            	really amazing web applications. "What's the difference between an application and a web site"? I can hear you asking. Well the answer is simple,
	            	a static site does not change. This site is an example. If I want to make any changes to what YOU see I have to go into the source code, make
	            	the change, save it, then upload it to the web server. What applications do is make the server do all the work. With a web application you can
	            	make changes, add content, change content, etc. all from the browser. This is how comment systems, shopping cart / ecommerce, and big sites like 
	            	Facebook and Twitter work.</p>            
	            <p>Most (if not all) coders are familiar with the "hello, world" program. When learning a new programming language printing some text to the
	            	screen is typically an easy and often repeated command, so it is a logical place for my blog begin. And what else is a blog besides text printed
	            	 to a
	            	screen?</p>
