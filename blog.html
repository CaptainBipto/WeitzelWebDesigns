            <p>Hello World! My name is Norm, and I'm delighted and surprised that you've found my blog. As this is my first post I'm going to use it to
            	lay out my hopes and dreams for this site and business. </p>
            	
            <p>Web design and development is a new skill for me, and it was not a straight path that brought me here. Originally I had an idea for an 
            	Android app that I wanted to build. After doing some research I discovered that despite looking relatively simple mobile apps are quite 
            	complicated to build, especially for someone that has minimal programming experience. Prior to my current journey my only experience was
            	one semester of Pascal in high school!</p>
          </div>
            <div class="large-6 columns">
            <img src="img/helloWorld.jpg" />
          </div> 
          </div>
          <div class="row">
          	<div class="large-12 columns">
            <p>So I began learning. I looked all over the web, read articles, watched tutorials, and realized that I was in over my head. While I remembered
            	some of the basic programming principals from my high school days I had a lot to learn to get my feet under me. I went over to 
            	<a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> and started learning.</p>
            <p>After getting the basics down there I branched out and found many more resources to learn from. I started building simple web pages
            	and getting comfortable with all the different components. Somewhere along the way I realized that instead of trying to come up with
            	fake sites to make to build my skills, I should try some real world applications.</p>
            <p>So I tried recreating web sites of places and business I knew. That naturally led to me adding my own touches and improvements, and
            	 eventually led to me completely redesigning several sites.</p>
            <p>And that's how Weitzel Web Designs was born. I realized that I was doing work that was (in my opinion) better. After finding out how
            	much some folks were paying for what seemed to be relatively simple sites blew me away. I decided I could do better work for less money</p>
            <p>As far as the business goes, that's where we're at. I haven't signed any paying customers yet, but I hope to soon. But there's more to life
            	than making money. I've realized that I really enjoy web design and development! So I'm still honing my skills, writing as much code as 
            	I can, and learning as much as I can. The Android app may still be in my future, but I've got some other shiney new objects to play with
            	for now.</p>
            <p>My current project is learning a programming language called Ruby, and more specifically how to use a framework called Ruby on Rails to develop
            	really amazing web applications. "What's the difference between an application and a web site"? I can hear you asking. Well the answer is simple,
            	a static site does not change. This site is an example. If I want to make any changes to what YOU see I have to go into the source code, make
            	the change, save it, then upload it to the web server. What applications do is make the server do all the work. With a web application you can
            	make changes, add content, change content, etc. all from the browser. This is how comment systems, shopping cart / ecommerce, and big sites like 
            	Facebook and Twitter work.</p>            
            <p>Most (if not all) coders are familiar with the "hello, world" program. When learning a new programming language printing some text to the
            	screen is typically an easy and often repeated command, so it is a logical place for my blog begin. And what else is a blog besides text printed
            	 to a
            	screen?</p>

        <P>This site requires a subscription, but it's got some great lessons and tutorials for web
        	design and development. These are much more in depth than Codecademy. They've got very active instructors,
        	as well as a forum that is very useful. It's been my main source for learning Rails</P>
