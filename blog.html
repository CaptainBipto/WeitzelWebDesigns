        <h3>Newton's First Law</h3>

          	<p>Some laws of nature are simply inescapable. For example- </p>
          	<blockquote>Every object in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in that state of motion unless an external force is applied 
          		to it.</blockquote>
          	<p>I have a theory that this concept of inertia applies not only to physical objects, but to the behavior of individuals as well.
          		Now I don't have any evidence, and my use of the word theory is nothing short of scientific blsaphemy. So I suppose I should
          		relable it a hypothesis. But then again, a hypothesis is supposed to be an educated guess based on existing data. I have no
          		existing data. All I have is a hairbrained idea I came up with.</p>

          <div class="large-12 columns"> 
          	<p>When I think about where I am in life hindsight allows me to pretty clearly see how I ended up where I am today. I can see
          		what "unbalanced forces" were acting on me. As a child my parents were constantly pushing me (in a good way). They challenged
          		me and held me accountable. With that force in place I did well in high school, participated in extracirricular activities,
          		and got myself into college.</p>
          	<p>Once in college the "unbalenced" force that was my parents was greatly reduced. I was out of the nest and on my own. So what 
          		did I do? I did what any 18 year old would do. I did well enough in school to pass my classes, and partied. If it weren't for my
          		wife, it's quite possible I'd be that 30-something year old guy that you run into at college parties. It makes me shiver to
          		think I could have been THAT guy. I'm exaggerating, or at least I hope I am. But my point is that I was just kind of coasting
          		along. I didn't have much motivation to improve myself or succeed. I was at a mediocre school doing mediorcre things. But lucky
          		for me my wife and I started dating at this time.</p>
          	<p>She became my new "unbalanced force". With her I had a reason to try and figure out where my future was taking me. I had a force
          		pushing me in a better direction, and I still do. Then my kids came along. At first they're a drag. The require almost 24/7
          		attention and intervention. You have to completely reprioritize everything in your life. Video games? Only when you're rocking
          		a baby to sleep. Sleep? Only in 2 hour chuncks. A clean house? Riiiiiiiight. Having babies is like treading water. The best you can
          		do is keep your head above the surface.</p>
          	<p>But as they get older something amazing happens. For me it was an actual moment I remember. I was in my room intending to take a 
          		quick look at the news or something online. But one click lead to another, and before I knew it I had read a few articles. Then
          		it dawned on me that I had just had 10 consecutive minutes of peace and quiet. My kids were playing together in their room and I
          		had time. I felt like <a href="http://youtu.be/UAxARJyaTEA?rel=0&start=105&end=123&version=3" target="_blank">this guy from The Twilight Zone</a>
          		before he broke his glasses!</p>
          	<p>And at first I acted like that guy as well. Books weren't my thing. I mostly just enjoyed having a bit of time here and there just to
          		have some basic quiet time. I'd surf the web, get some chores done, or maybe play some video games! It was fantastic. But at some point
          		I started to feel like I was squandering my new freedom. Now that the kids were old enough to have a little bit of autonomy that draggin
          		force was not longer acting on me. In fact now they were a pushing force in the opposite direction.</p>
          	<p>When I think about raising my kids I think about what I want them to see in me. I think about what example I want to set. They're at an age
          		where it's obvious that they're watching. I want to be a better person because of them.</p>
          	<p>So as my previous blog entries have talked about, I started trying to be productive. Now this is just a very simple anecdotal example and
          		carries no weight at all. But looking at people I know, friends and family, you can kind of see this idea apply to just about everybody.
          		Everybody has different factors in their lives either motivating them or holding them back. And just to clarify, something that "holds you back"
          		isn't always a bad thing. My kids held me back a ton as babies, but as little boys they're pushing me forwards. And they're awesome.</p>
          	<p>As a scientific hypothesis or model, I'm more than likely full of hot air. Behavior and psychology are far more complicated that what I've
          		described. But, what I'm thinking, is that I may have the nugget of a self-help book. So keep your eyes out.</p>

        <h6>Written by <span class="author">Norman Weitzel</span> on Febuary 12, 2014.</h6> 
        <div class="row">
          <div class="large-12 columns">
          	<p>I've been bad. I've been missing in action for about 6 weeks now. I'm afraid I do not have a decent excuse of any sort.
          		I could say that I've been busy. But who isn't busy? I've had my laptop in my lap for countless hours, I'm up to speed
          		on the latest internet gossip, and I regularly nap. So being busy isn't going to cut it. I can't say that I forgot, 
          		because I haven't. Updating my blog has crossed my mind about once a week or so. So the idea has been there. I think my
          		best excuse is that I've lost a bit of my mojo.</p>
  			<p>What do I mean by I've lost my mojo? It's simple really, I had no idea what I wanted to write! I've been meaning to do an update 
  				on my New Years Goals (which I'll hit on shortly), but that's rather dry and not very exciting. So we'll make it nice and quick.</p>
 		  </div>
 		</div>
 				
 	    <div class="row">
 		    <div class="large-1 columns"><h1></h1></div>
	        <div class="panel large-10 columns">
	 		  <ul>
				<li><p>No new clients yet. It seems that folks without websites, or folks with bad websites, seem to be happy that way. I'll keep working
					at this one regardless. It turns out the low hanging fruit was rotten, so now I have to do a little more work. I don't know if I'll
					be able to make 1 client / 3 months, but I'll still try.</p></li>
				<li><p>Learning SASS has taken a little bit of a back seat to other priorites. I've started putting those 30 minutes towards <a href="http://www.duolingo.com">Duolingo</a>
					and improving my Spanish. So far I could probably communicate with a toddler, but I am getting noticeably better each day. I've
					also started playing my guitar again. I can't say I've been playing every day, but I'm getting back on track. As for SASS, I found that 
					I really don't mind raw CSS for the time being. So we'll keep that on the list of things to do eventually.</p></li>
				<li><p>And as for my functional Ruby Site, I feel I should have dfined that goal a bit more. I still have a lot to learn,
					but I've got enough Ruby and Rails under my belt to be dangerous. I've got a prototype site working, and I'm consistently
					adding to it, and it does "stuff" right now. It just doesn't do anything remotely useful or interesting. I could
					publish it right now, but what's the point? But I do have a vision, and I know what I want my site to do. So the spoiler free
					version is that this one is on track.</p></li>
	 		  </ul>
	  		</div>
          	<div class="large-1 columns"><h1></h1></div>
       </div>
       <div class="row">
           <div class="large-12">
           	<p>So what am I doing now? Well as I mentioned earlier my web development time is spent learning more about Ruby and Rails. It's
           		a pretty steep learning curve. The upside is that once you start wraping your head around it and understanding how to use
           		some of the features, new concepts tend to integrate easier and easier as you go along. I'm still a novice, but I'm a novice
           		that can at least build a basic site. By basic I mean I can make a site that has a database with different elements, I can
           		make those elements talk to each other (eg. a user can register for my site, publish some comments, edit or delete
           		those comments, log out, etc.), and I can make it look pretty. It may not sound like much, but it feels like I've climbed 
           		a mountain to get here.</p>
           	<p>If you read my previous post you also know that I've been on a bit of a fitness kick recently. Good news there as well. I've lost 
           		about 15 - 20 pounds (20% is a big margin, but I realized my scale lies sometimes). I'm looking much better than I used to. If I
           		recline until my abs are tight, you can feel bumps! I'm pretty excited about that. So at the moment I'm bulking up, trying to actually
           		gain weight, which is weird. But the plan is to add 5-10 pounds of muscle, then cut some fat again following that. It's weird, because to 
           		add weight you have to eat. Until recently I've never worried about calorie content. But it turns out that for me to eat enough to intentionally
           		gain weight, I've got to make eating a hobby. SO I'll keep you posted on that.</p>
           	<p>So that's what's new with me. I'm sure it's been quite an anti-climax to wait 6 weeks for this post. But now you understand why
           		it's been 6 weeks! The upside to posting this today is that it's jogged a couple things in my head that I had some thoughts on,
           		so you might see a couple new posts in the near future.</p>
           	<p> In the meantime</p>

        <h3>'Tis the Season</h3>
        <h6>Written by <span class="author">Norman Weitzel</span> on December 18, 2013.</h6> 
        <div class="row">
          <div class="large-9 columns">
          	<p>It's Christmas time again! Christmas has always been one of my favorite times of the year. Now if only adults got a "Winter Break"
          		like the school kids do it would really feel like Christmas.</p>
          	<P>Following Christmas I am sure we will have the annual media tsunami of Top 10 lists, Year in Review stories, and New Year's Resolutions. The top 10
          		lists get old after a while, and the Year in Review stories can be somewhat interesting. But what really interests me are the New Year's
          		Resolutions.</P>
          	<p>I've never been a big believer in making New Year's Resolutions and I think the <a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/"
          		target="_blank"> statistics</a> will back me up. I think that more often than not people bite off a bit more than they can chew, give a half hearted effort, and then fail. I don't think that is an effective
          		method of self improvement.</p>
          	<p>I've been on a recent self improvement kick, and I'm not entirely sure where the inspiration came from. For just over 2 years I had been
          		more than happy to just coast along in my rut. Then I'm not sure what changed, but I started to go a little bit stir crazy. Then I began
          		looking into learning about programming and web development (See <a href="#121313">my previous post</a>). Once I got that ball rolling I 
          		decided that I needed to clean up my diet and get back into shape. I went from drinking at least a six pack of soda per day to none. I 
          		still have an occasional soft drink when I eat out, but that's pretty much it. I don't have to go to Costco once a week now for a case of
          		Pepsi. I went from being a couch potato who went for a run on average once every 3 months or so to having an actual plan and exercise 
          		routine. (If you're interested <a href="http://www.hasfit.com" target="_blank" >HasFit.com</a> has been a great resource)</p>

          	<p>So far all of these efforts have had visible and objective results with relatively minor lifestyle changes. 6 months ago I could use the internet
          		pretty well. Now I can help to create the internet! That's a powerful feeling! Looking at my belt I can see the notches that I used to use, and
          		what I currently use. I can see a difference in my body when I look in the mirror. By New Year's I'll look like Christian Bale in Batman Begins.</p>
          	<div class="row">
          		<div class="large-6 columns">
          			<p>Just joking about Christian Bale. Just look at this man.</p>
          			<p>So now I'll get to my point. Rather than making a proclimation of a major lifestyle change a la a New Year's Resolution, I think it's a much
          		better idea to commit to baby steps. Instead of "This year I'm going to get in shape" I think it's a lot more reasonable to say "Starting with
          		the new year I am going to start working out for 30 minutes 3 days a week", or instead of "I'm going to learn Spanish" something more like 
          		"I'm going to use DuoLingo for 10 minutes a day". I think a strategy of small changes that give real results is a much more effective method.</p>

          	</div>
          	
          	<p>Now that I've finished my rant on traditional New Year's Resolutions, I'm going to give my goals for 2014.</p>
          	
          	<div class="row">
          		<div class="large-1 columns"><h1></h1></div>
	          	<div class="panel large-10 columns">
		          	<ul>
		          		<li>Gain an average of 1 new client every 3 months</li>
		          		<p>Weitzel Web Designs is still in it's infancy. I want to build meaningful relationships with my clients and deliver them quality work
		          			that they are 100% satisfied with. Being new to the business side of this I don't want to over commit myself. That's why it's a low number.</p>
		          		<li>Spend 30 minutes of each work day learning a CSS Pre-processor (probably SASS) and have it be part of the development process by the end of the year</li>
		          		<p>CSS is the programming language that provides the style for web pages (fonts, colors, borders, etc.). It is relatively limited compared to other
		          			programming languages. Using a pre-processor like SASS can make you a much more efficient developer. This will most likely be my next big project
		          			once I am a bit more stable at using Ruby on Rails</p>
		          		<li>Develop a functional site using Ruby on Rails by July</li>
		          		<p>Right now I am in the shallow end of Ruby on Rails. Much of the development process still goes over my head, and I have to re-read and re-watch
		          			lessons pretty regularly. But I'm making progress, and that's what matters. I think by July I'll have enough of Rails under my belt to 
		          			unleash something on the world. Not 100% sure what that something will be yet, so stay tuned.</p>
		          	</ul>
		         </div>
		         <div class="large-1 columns"></div>
	         </div>
	         
          	<p>That's my plan. If by this time next year I have 4 clients, am using SASS on my projects, and have a Rails based site up and running I will have
          		achieved my goals. Each item of the list is relatively small, but will provide objective and concrete results. Each item is also going to be a 
          		challenge. For example, I'm not good at sales. So far my pitch has essentially been "Want a web site? No? Ok...here's my card". Not literally of 
          		course, but to achieve my goal of developing clients I'm going to have to get better at selling myself and my skills. Each goal has it's own unique 
          		challenges that I'm going to have to overcome.</p>
          	<p>And that's what a New Year's resolution is all about, ending next year as a better person than you ended this year.</p>

	            	Android app that I wanted to build. After doing some research I discovered that despite looking relatively simple mobile apps are quite 
	            	complicated to build, especially for someone that has minimal programming experience. Prior to my current journey my only experience was
	            	one semester of Pascal in high school!</p>
	            <p>So I began learning. I looked all over the web, read articles, watched tutorials, and realized that I was in over my head. While I remembered
	            	some of the basic programming principals from my high school days I had a lot to learn to get my feet under me. I went over to 
	            	<a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> and started learning.</p>

	          <div class="large-6 columns centered">
	            <img src="img/helloWorld.jpg" />
	          </div> 
	          <br>
	        </div>
	
	
	          <div class="row">
	          	<div class="large-9 columns">
	            
	            <p>After getting the basics down there I branched out and found many more resources to learn from. I started building simple web pages
	            	and getting comfortable with all the different components. Somewhere along the way I realized that instead of trying to come up with
	            	fake sites to make to build my skills, I should try some real world applications.</p>
	            <p>So I tried recreating web sites of places and business I knew. That naturally led to me adding my own touches and improvements, and
	            	 eventually led to me completely redesigning several sites.</p>
	            <p>And that's how Weitzel Web Designs was born. I realized that I was doing work that was (in my opinion) better. After finding out how
	            	much some folks were paying for what seemed to be relatively simple sites I was blown away. I decided I could do better work for less money</p>
	            <p>As far as the business goes, that's where we're at. I haven't signed any paying customers yet, but I hope to soon. But there's more to life
	            	than making money. I've realized that I really enjoy web design and development! So I'm still honing my skills, writing as much code as 
	            	I can, and learning as much as I can. The Android app may still be in my future, but I've got some other shiney new objects to play with
	            	for now.</p>
	            <p>My current project is learning a programming language called Ruby, and more specifically how to use a framework called Ruby on Rails to develop
	            	really amazing web applications. "What's the difference between an application and a web site"? I can hear you asking. Well the answer is simple,
	            	a static site does not change. This site is an example. If I want to make any changes to what YOU see I have to go into the source code, make
	            	the change, save it, then upload it to the web server. What applications do is make the server do all the work. With a web application you can
	            	make changes, add content, change content, etc. all from the browser. This is how comment systems, shopping cart / ecommerce, and big sites like 
	            	Facebook and Twitter work.</p>            
	            <p>Most (if not all) coders are familiar with the "hello, world" program. When learning a new programming language printing some text to the
	            	screen is typically an easy and often repeated command, so it is a logical place for my blog begin. And what else is a blog besides text printed
	            	 to a
	            	screen?</p>
